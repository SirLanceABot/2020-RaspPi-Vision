/*
  UDP receive program

 Usage:
   Add this file or multiple files - or equivalents that actually route the messages to the right places - to the roboRIO
   Start the thread or multiple threads if each thread processes its own messages
   
   In a RPi test environment with no roboRIO use the below 5 statements in Main.java
   On the roboRIO use something similar in the right place (likely robot.java)
    private static UdpReceive testUDPreceive; // test UDP receiver in place of a roboRIO
    private static Thread UDPreceiveThread; // remove these or at least don't start this thread if using the roboRIO

    // start test UDP receiver
    UDPreceive = new UdpReceive(5800); // port must match what the RPi is sending on
    UDPreceiveThread = new Thread(UDPreceive, "4237UDPreceive");
    UDPreceiveThread.start();
